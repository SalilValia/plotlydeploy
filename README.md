# plotlydeploy

## Summary of the Challenge. 
Our main purpose was creating an HTML/Javascript project that has a customized dashboard with a bar, bubble and gauge chart for different types of bacteria. The dashboard is able to be filtered by the different bacteria ID's in a drop down menu. It was annoying not being able to check our charts normally by opening up the index html like previous challenges. After understanding how to post our html file into our public github pages it made it much more easier to share the link. I am still having difficulty on how to post my guage chart. for some reason it is not loading up. 
Here is the link to view the html page to see the dashboard.
